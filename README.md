# Simple Todo App

This project was created for Sprint 7 of the Software Engineering program at [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com/)
A basic html css and javascript structure was provided. The javascript was refactored to use Javascript classes form Todo production and form validation.

## Functionality

TheSimple ToDo App is a web application that allows you to create Todo's, mark them completed, and delete them. There is simple validation requiring the todo description to be greater than 2 characters and disallows the date to be too far in the future. When the form is submitted it is cleared and the submit button is disabled. uuidv4 was implemented to give todo checkbox's and associated labels unique id's.
